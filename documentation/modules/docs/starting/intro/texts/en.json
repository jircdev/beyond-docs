      "p1": "BeyondJS is a typescript-based meta framework, designed to create projects that work in different JavaScript execution environments, keeping the focus on ensuring a universal development experience for the developer. It does so by remaining agnostic to existing libraries and technologies, seeking to leave a standardized path that allows their integration.",

      "p2": "A project is defined by specifying its scope, name, and at least one distribution. The distributions allow identifying the execution environment in which the project is expected to work and some additional data that may be relevant for the compilation and deployment process. Likewise, multiple distributions are able to be  configured simultaneously, giving the developer the flexibility to validate the behavior of their project in different configured ecosystems.",
