This tutorial walks through the main flow of development with <strong>Beyond</strong> and clearly shows the benefits it offers in its use.
The purpose of this development is for end-users/developers who want to learn while practicing, therefore the concepts
that define the structure of <strong>Beyond</strong> are addressed in a general approach, focusing on making a quick, concise, and clear
exercise out of it. We strongly suggest accessing the corresponding chapters in the documentation to understand some concepts
better.

The tutorial is structures as follows:

Dashboard.
Creation of the first module.
Back-end integration
Navigation

We suggest completing the tutorial, to prove how in a short amount of time youÂ´ll be able to integrate client and server-code using the same JavaScript structure.

Before you start, we recommend revising these concepts to have a clear concept about them, while you go through the tutorial.

<strong>Bundle:</strong> Represents a set of source files that generates a single final file, included in the browser.
<strong>Module:</strong> Represents one or multiple bundles.
<strong>Processor:</strong> Represents the code processor, compiler, or transpiler of the technology being used.
