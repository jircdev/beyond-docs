<Title>Light & Dark theme</Title>

BeyondJS provides a simple mechanism for supporting light and dark themes, consisting of two parts.

-   The style template.
-   Data-beyond-mode attribute.

Themes in the template

The application template is already configured to support the light and dark theme and supplies a custom CSS property definition file for each theme selection. Then, in the definition.scss file, we have the following code:

**definition.scss**

<Code>
{`
@use 'dark';
@use 'light';
:root {
  @include light.properties();
  @media(prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    @include dark.properties();
  }
}

html[data-beyond-mode="light"] {
@include light.properties();
}

html[data-beyond-mode="dark"] {
@include dark.properties();
}

`}

</Code>

The above code makes the variables, set in the dark and light files, available for each respective theme.

In most cases, if a widget requires validation of the theme it is using, it may be enough to use the host-context selector to define it from a style file, as shown in the following example:

<Code>
{`
:host-context(html[data-beyond-mode]) {
    //styles here...
}

`}

</Code>

There are some cases where it might be necessary for the widgets to dynamically find out about the theme change. For this, the widgets' object API can be used.

<Code>
{`
:host-context(html[data-beyond-mode]) {
    //styles here...
}

`}

</Code>

The above line adds to all existing widgets the attribute data-beyond-mode with the value dark.
