<Title>Projects</Title>

BeyondJS, offers an architecture focused on providing an efficient way to implement solutions, based on microservices interconnected with other microservices in the backend and with applications with micro-frontend structures if we talk about the client, without neglecting the possibility of creating simpler projects in fewer steps.

To better explain the concept, one can think of a service that offers authentication management in applications. It is natural to believe that there may be developers who need to use the service from a web project with client code, and developers who are working on the backend and can also use the service to validate the session before certain actions.

From the perspective of BeyondJS, the Auth service could be seen as a project that contains two distributions, one to generate the client code and another to generate the backend code, both with a single source code. The code deployed from the distributions could be made available in both distributions as an **NPM** package and made available for use by any developer in projects made or not with BeyondJS.

Likewise, if the projects consuming ´Auth´ are BeyondJS projects, they could also import into ´Auth´ via the BeyondJS module import system.
