<Title>Create a Module</Title>

This page assumes that you have already read the <Link to="/modules/intro">module introduction..</Link>

The modules are created and managed through the module.json configuration files. These have the alternative of being created manually or through the Dashboard interface.

<SubTitle>Creation from the Dashboard</SubTitle>

To be able to create a module, first you must have created a project before, and this needs to be active in the Dashboard.

The option to create projects is a feature available when a project is active on the Dashboard. In order to see them, it is necessary to open the project by accessing its detail board.

When the project is active, you can see the option in the PreAside. By clicking on it, a modal will appear, allowing you the alternative to create a blank module or select a template.

Later, a form appears that requests the rest of the necessary data associated with the type of bundle that will be added to the module and the processors that to be contained.

Module data

-   String **Module Name:** Corresponds to the name with which the module to be created could be imported or used.
-   **Web Component Name** string: Applies to widget-type bundles. It should follow the web component naming standard, all lowercase and with a dash.
-   Optional **URL:** Applies to modules with a page-widget type bundle. Defines the URL's access.
-   **Vue** boolean: Adds the Vue renderer.
-   **Svelte** boolean: Adds the Svelte processor.

<SubTitle>Manual creation</SubTitle>

The module configuration follows the same principle as the rest of the configuration elements in BeyondJS and must be created in a file named module.json.

The module.json receives at least two properties: The module name and the bundle configuration.

<Code>
{`
{
    "name": "first-module",
    "platforms": [
        "web"
    ]
    "code" : {
        "ts": {
          "path": "ts",
          "files": [
            "*"
          ]
        },
        "sass": {
          "path": "scss",
          "files": [
            "*"
          ]
        }
    }
}

`}

</Code>

In the example above, a module named first-module is being created, with a bundle code that contains a sass processor and a ts processor that process Sass and Typescript code respectively; and that will be bundled for the web platform.

A module can contain several bundles, defined as properties of the module's configuration object, and as pure module receives as a value a configuration object that, apart from the processors, can receive some additional properties depending on the bundle type. You can read more in detail about this in the <Link to="/docs/bundles">bundle's chapter.</Link>
