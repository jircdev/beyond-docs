BeyondJS is a next-generation framework designed to create universal JavaScript modules, ready to be distributed and reused
as any NPM package you know, without the need to use bundlers or additional tools.

Our goal is to simplify the process and the overall development experience, taking any JavaScript project to its most essential concept: a package.

With BeyondJS, you can create packages for any environment, using the knowledge you already know and focusing on what's important, your business logic.

It is a Typescript-based meta-framework and works directly with its API to abstract the programmer from the compilation/transpilation process to JavaScript and provide an optimized and fast error handling.

In addition, it is compatible with NPM packages that follow the standard defined by Node, so you can integrate it with a large number of libraries.

The modular+universal architecture of BeyondJS allows programming for any JavaScript execution environment and developing the following types of solutions:

-   Web projects,
-   Hybrid mobile apps,
-   Hybrid desktop apps,
-   Monolithic microservices and backends.
-   Extensions.
-   Microfrontends or Widgets to integrate them in existing projects.

In summary, BeyondJS is a tool that allows you to create universal modules and distribute them as NPM packages, simplifying the development process and ensuring a homogeneous experience in any JavaScript execution environment.
