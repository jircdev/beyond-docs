<Title>Structure of a project</Title>

BeyondJS has a configurable architecture that allows for flexible project structures. However, when creating a project through the Workspace or ´beyond-first-project´, the initial structure is created as follows:

<Subtitle>Structure</Subtitle>

This command creates the following structure:

// Img

-   A <Link to="/docs/project/json">project.json</Link>, file, with the project settings.
-   A <Link to="/docs/beyond/json">beyond.json</Link> file that allows you to manage configurations for the development server.
-   Template/folder with the project template structure. This folder applies to both web and mobile projects. Read more detail about the template system <Link to="/docs/basics/template">here.</Link>

The folder structure can vary and be extended based on project considerations.

<Subtitle>Directory Management</Subtitle>

BeyondJS follows a directory structure based on keeping semantics simple and concise, enabling the developer to locate themselves based on folder names. However, the developer may have a structure standard he wishes to follow, for which changes to the directory configuration are allowed.

The project's modules are usually located, by convention, in the modules folder. This is defined in the project.json, in the module property.

<Code>
{`
"modules": {
    "path": "modules"
}

`}

</Code>

Like all directory configuration properties, the module.path property evaluates the value received relative to where the directory is located. In other words, the modules folder must be located, as in the above example, at the same height as the project.json file. If this property is removed, BeyondJS will try to find the modules at the project's root-directory, which corresponds to the location of the module.json.
