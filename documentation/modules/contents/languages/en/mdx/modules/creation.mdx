Modules are configured via a JSON object which is stored in a file
called `module.json`. The basic structure of this file is as follows:

<CodeBox title="module.json" language="json">

{`{
  "name": "module-name",
  "platforms": ["browser"] 
  "bundle": { 
    // bundle properties
  }
}`}

</CodeBox>

> To create a module, it is necessary to have previously created a package.

As you can see in the example above, the `module.json` file
can contain the following properties:

-   `name`: is the name of the module.
-   `platfoms`: is a list indicating the platforms for which the bundle is available.
    the bundle is available for. If not specified, the bundle is considered to be compatible with all platforms.
    bundle is considered to be compatible with all platforms.
-   `[bundleName]`: is used to specify the type of bundle you want to create in the module.
    to create in the module. A module can contain multiple bundles by simply
    adding more properties with the name of each additional bundle.
    he value of this property is an object containing the bundle configuration,
    and the properties within this object vary depending on the type of bundle being added.
    being added. For more information on the different types of bundles and their
    bundle types and their configuration, see the bundle section of the documentation.

Recalling the example defined in the introduction, which had the following characteristics:

-   An auth.ts file with an Auth object that serves as a template and allows to make the call for login.
-   A user.ts file with a User object that exposes the user's information in case he/she logs in.
-   A styles.scss style file
-   A graphical interface component form.tsx.

The `module.json` for this module could be defined as follows:

<Code title="module.json" language="json">
{`
{
    "name": "login",
    "code": {
        "ts": {
            "path": "ts",
            "files": ["*"]
        },
        "sass": {
            "path": "sass",
            "files": ["*"]
        }
    }
}
`}

</Code>

In the previous example, a module named first-module is being created, with a bundle code that contains a sass processor and a ts processor that process Sass and Typescript code respectively and that will be packaged for web platform.

A module can contain several bundles, these are defined as properties of the module configuration object and a module pureciben as value a configuration object that apart from the processors, can receive some additional properties depending on the type of bundle.

in <Link href="/docs/bundles">The bundles section.</Link>.
