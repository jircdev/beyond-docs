<Title>Processors</Title>.

Many of the tools or languages used in the web environment require prior processing to be interpreted by browsers or runtime environments, this is the work done by processors.

BeyondJS offers a series of integrated processors, which allow you to use the main technologies of the web industry and provides support for new processors can be integrated if required.

BeyondJS works differently from packagers such as Webpack or Parcel. It does not need to evaluate the dependency tree of a project, nor does it need to apply tree shaking techniques. Thanks to its modular nature and through processors, code packaging is done at the bundle level.

Processors are BeyondJS components that allow to interpret, parse, transpile or compile code (as the case may be) from the languages or technologies used in a <Link href="/docs/bundles">Bundle.</Link>.

<Subtitle>Existing processors</Subtitle>.

-   **ts:** allows working with typescript and `tsx` files for react.
-   sass:\*\* provides support for working with SASS files with .scss extension.
-   vue:\*\* Provides support for working with single-file-components files for vue.
-   svelte:\*\* Provides support for working with svelte single-file-component files.

<Subtitle>Properties</Subtitle>.

All processors have the following properties:

-   **path** (string) optional: Allows to define the directory where the processor files are located. If a value is added, it is interpreted as a directory relative to the location of the defined module.json.

-   files\*\* (array) optional: Allows defining the list of files or folders included in the processor. If the path property is defined, the files will be searched inside the specified directory, otherwise, they will be searched relative to the location of the module.json. It is possible to pass as value of the property an array with an entry \*, this way it would be indicating that all the files in the specified directory are included.

<Subtitle>Examples</Subtitle>.

The following example corresponds to the definition of a code type bundle, the details are explained below:

-   The bundle makes use of two processors: sass and ts.
-   The sass processor includes all the files in the /code/scss directory which is relative to the location of the module.json file.
-   The ts processor only includes the component.ts file which is located in the /code/ts directory relative to the location of the module.json file.
