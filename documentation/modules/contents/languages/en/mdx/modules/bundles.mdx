<DocHeader pretitle="Modules" title="Bundles" />

In BeyondJS, bundles are sets of files and configurations that are used to organize and
structure the code of an application. Each bundle can contain one or more files of different types,
such as JavaScript code, CSS styles, images, etc. Bundles can also contain configurations
for code processors, such as TypeScript or Sass.

Bundles are defined as properties of the `module.json` file. For example,
the following code defines a bundle of type `code`.

<Code>
    {`
  "name": "icons",
  "code": {
    "ts": {
      "path": "ts",
      "files": [
        "*"
      ]
    },
    "mdx": {
      "path: "ts/mdx",
      "files": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  }
`}
</Code>

It is important to note that a module can contain more than one bundle,
for this it is only necessary to add another property with the name of the additional bundle.
However, a module cannot contain two bundles of the same type.

> The bundles receive processors as values. Processors are objects that indicate
> the type of files to be processed and their location. BeyondJS allows for the definition or aggregation of.
> new processors, which makes the concept of processors extensible. You can check the section

Imagine you need to create the interface of a registration form.
The registration form could be divided into two layers:

-   the user interface based on HTML code and the screen styles.
-   The logic associated with validations and functionalities.

To carry out the development, it is necessary to create some files in Typescript
that include the logic and elements of the interface, as well as other style files.
In <BeyondJS/>, this involves working with at least two basic processors:
Typescript and Sass. The former generates JavaScript code and the latter generates CSS code.

As explained above, the ability of a bundle to generate one or several
final files depends on the processors included in its packaging.
If only JavaScript code needs to be created, a single file is generated.
If, on the other hand, CSS code is also needed, two files are generated.

<Title tag="h2" text="Traversal Bundles" />
The transversal bundles, are defined the same as the other bundles, but have a particularity that offers productive advantages:
the code of a traversal bundle is compiled into a single file.

BeyondJS places, integrates and unifies them in a single bundle or final file. Start bundles are a clear example of this, allowing the programmer to define the logic to be executed at application startup.

-   **Widget**: They contain the code of a web-component.
    Pages and layouts are handled as widgets. You can read more about this bundle type at.
    {" "}
    <Link href="/widgets">The Widgets section.</Link>.
-   **Code**: Bundle that allows you to create various functionalities to be consumed from another bundle or module. Supports multi-processor integration.
-   TS (Typescript)\*\*: only supports the processor for handling typescript files.
-   Bridge\*\*: backend code bundle, which generates client code and provides the websocket connection to connect the client and the backend.
-   Backend**: only supports code to be executed in execution environments such as **Node** or **Deno\*\*.
-   Vue\*\*: Bundle specific for module management with the Vue Framework.
-   Svelte\*\*: specific for Svelte code management and its single file component structure.
-   Start\*\*: Transversal Bundle, useful if it is required to execute logic when starting the application.
-   Text-start\*\*: Transversal Bundle, which  
     allows to handle multi-language texts
    required at application start-up.
    application start-up.
