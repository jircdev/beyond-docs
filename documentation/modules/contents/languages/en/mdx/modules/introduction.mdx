In <BeyondJS/>, modules are the basic unit of development and are divided into two concepts:
Internal Modules and Modules.

Internal Modules represent the concept of traditional JavaScript modules,
i.e. files with independent tasks and their own scope.
However, developers have the ability to define whether these internal modules are accessible to be used by the developers.
internal modules are accessible to be used by other internal modules or not by using a special comment
not by using a special comment named`/*bundle*/`.

On the other hand, Modules in BeyondJS are a larger unit of development that is composed of several internal modules.
consists of several internal modules, as well as other resources such as styles, images and text,
images and text. BeyondJS packages these modules into a single file depending on the type of
the type of processor used.

To illustrate this, let's take as an example a "login" module that consists of.
the following elements:

-   An `auth.ts` file with an Auth object that serves as a model and
    allows the login call to be made

<Code>

{`
export /_bundle_/ class Auth {

    constructor(options) {
        this.options = options;
    }

    login(username, password) {
        // lógica de inicio de sesión
    }

    logout() {
        // lógica de cierre de sesión
    }

}`}

</Code>

-   A `user.ts` file with a User object that exposes
    the user's information in case he/she logs in.

<Code>

{`
import { Auth } from './auth.js';

export /*bundle*/ class User {
    constructor(options) {
        this.options = options;
        this.auth = new Auth(options);
    }

    getCurrentUser() {
        // lógica para obtener el usuario actual
    }

}
`}

</Code>

-   A styles file `styles.scss` and
-   a graphical interface component `form.tsx`.

Based on EcmaScript, the files auth.ts, user.ts and form.tsx
are independent modules that expose an object. However,
in terms of functionality, the application module is composed of these files in their entirety.
files in their entirety.

Therefore, <BeyondJS/> conceptualizes modules as a set of files defined in a module.js file.
defined in a module.json file, where all elements within this module can be used with each other.
module can be used with each other. In addition, the programmer can define
exactly which elements to export to an external module, as in the "user" object example, which is
of the "user" object, which is exported via the magic comment /_bundle_/.

<BeyondJS /> packages the modules as separate bundles. You can learn more about this in the module creation section.

As a developer, you're probably only interested in other modules being able to
consume the form view and the User object to access user data.o.
