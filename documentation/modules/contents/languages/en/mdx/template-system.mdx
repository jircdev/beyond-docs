<Title>Template Systems</Title>

<Subtitle>Template of a project</Subtitle>

BeyondJS provides a simple but robust architecture for managing templates in projects, which has the following features:

-   **Styles:** Integrated support of LESS and SASS preprocessors.
-   **CSS properties:** Basic structure of variables that allows working with web components efficiently.
-   **Global Style:** Global stylesheet for the project.
-   **Override:** A unique feature that allows redefining styles and texts in existing modules without touching the original code.
-   **Code separation:** Independent handling of style files with automated process for generating of independent and optimized final files.
-   Integrated **Light & Dark Theme.**

<Subtitle>Settings</Subtitle>

The template configuration, like all elements in BeyondJS, is handled through a configuration file, whose name, by convention, is template.json, and is located in the template folder at the the project root. However, both name and location are configurable values in the <Link to="/project/config">project.json</Link>

The template can be managed from the <ELink to="https://workspace.beyondjs.com/">Workspace</ELink> and when a project is created, the default structure for its management is already configured.

Configuration properties explained below:

The application and global properties receive the same configuration parameters, but have different purposes.

**template.application**

The application configuration property represents the general styles file of the project, and its main focus is to be the location where the custom CSS properties are defined and any style that is required to be applied to the general document, external to the widgets.

The **custom properties** play a key role in managing widgets. Web components with Shadow DOM are not affected by the general styling of the website they are embedded into. However, the CSS properties can still be accessed and used.

Further detailed information on Style management, can be found in the <Link to="/docs/styles/template">Styles chapter of the template.</Link>

**template.global**

Its purpose is to provide the developer with the chance of sharing code between widgets. The files added into the global settings, are compiled into a file named global.css, which is included in the shadow dom of each widget, in order for them to have access to the styles.

<Subtitle>Parameter setting</Subtitle>

<Code>
{`
"application": {
    "processor": "sass",
    "path": "application",
    "files": [
      "*"
    ]
},
"global": {
    "processor": "sass",
    "path": "application",
    "files": [
      "*"
    ]
  }

`}

</Code>

As you can see in the code above, setting both properties works the same, they receive an object with the following properties:

As you can see from the code above, you can define three properties.

-   **processor:** Procesador a utilizar. Soporta sass y less
-   **path:** Directorio donde se encuentran los archivos, sino se define se buscaran todos los archivos relativos a la ubicación del archivo de configuración.
-   **files:**, el \* indica que se debe tomar en cuenta cualquier archivo adentro del path definido. Si se específican archivos por nombre, sólo se tomara en cuenta los archivos indicados.
