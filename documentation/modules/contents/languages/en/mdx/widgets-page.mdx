<Title>Widgets page</Title>

Page type widgets represent a page from a website or web application accessed through a URL. When a web project receives a request by URL, BeyondJS takes care of identifying the widget with that defined URL to initialize the component and make it available in the DOM.

<Code>
{`
"widget": {
    "route": "login"
    "layout: "main",
    "element": {
      "name": "login-page"
    },
....
}

`}

</Code>

Pages require the same configuration structure as any widget, but they also receive the following configuration parameters:

-   **route:** [string]: Defines the URL or path to the component.
-   **layout** [string] [optional]: y defines whether you want to use a layout or not on your page.
-   **vdir** [string] [optional]: This allows you to define if you want to handle any dynamic value in the URL.

<SubTitle>Route pattern</SubTitle>

URLs with dynamic values can be defined by adding variables to the route property with a syntax similar to template strings.

To exemplify it, let's suppose that you have a page where you need modifying a user's data, and you also need to manage the id through the URL. The widget's route property would have the following value:

<Code>
    {`
/user/edit/${userId}
`}
</Code>

The following URLs would match the created route:

-   `/user/edit/1`
-   `/user/edit/any-identifier`

These properties are available in the `uri` object available as a property in the widget controller and could be accessed from the controller as follows:

<Code>{`this.uri.vars.get('userId');`}</Code>

The uri object passed to view components as well. The way to access them depends on the implementation of each framework or tool.
