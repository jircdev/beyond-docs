A bare specifier is a way to specify a module in JavaScript for import without specifying the entire file.
Instead of putting the full path to the file, you specify only the name of the package or module as it is defined
in the package.json file and the module system takes care of finding and loading the correct corresponding file.

For example in the following code

<Code>{`import {someFunction} from 'my-module';`}</Code>

In this case, `my-module` is the name of the package or module being imported and `someFunction` is the name of the specific function being imported.a
function being imported.

The use of square brackets ``{}` }` indicates that a specific function is being imported rather than the entire module (destructuring).

BeyondJS makes use of the bare specifiers to manage the import and export of packages and modules in your projects and
manages their processing so that the code can be worked in the same way in any environment.

Currently import maps are not supported in a standardized way by browsers.
BeyondJS uses the SystemJS module system that provides support for import maps,
which allows you to specify the module path instead of using absolute paths.

In addition, BeyondJS automates import map generation and SystemJS configuration so developers don't have to worry about it.
developers don't have to worry about it.

This way, programmers can continue to use the EcmaScript standard for importing modules, even in environments
where it is not natively supported.
