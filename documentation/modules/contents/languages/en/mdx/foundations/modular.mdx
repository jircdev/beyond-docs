Modular architecture is key in BeyondJS, it allows the programmer to develop decoupled projects by breaking them down
into smaller parts that receive minimal configuration and are not affected by project growth.

For imports, BeyondJS makes use of bare specifiers, which allows to define module paths in a simpler and more efficient way.
easier and more efficient way.

In addition, BeyondJS offers a broader module concept compared to EcmaScript.
A BeyondJS module can be composed of several ESM modules, and you can easily define
which parts are accessible from outside the module, known as "internal modules". This allows for better
control and organization of the code in your project.

The structure of modules is defined by `module.json` configuration files,
with a structure like the following:

<Code>
{`
{
"name": "start-backend",
"bundle": "start",
"platforms": "backend",
"ts": {
"files": "*"
}
`}

</Code>
