<Title>Widget Creation</Title>

A widget is a type of bundle and in BeyondJS it has a modular loading philosophy and bundles are the final code representation to be executed in the JavaScript environment. If you want to read about all the types of bundles out there, you can head over to the <Link to="/docs/bundle">bundleâ€™s chapter.</Link>

Widgets exponentiate the advantages already existing in web components thanks to encapsulation. They allow the integration of different technologies with minimal configuration and offer a simple API to manage their properties, methods, and interaction with the rest of the components of a web project. Also, they can be made available as NPM packages and used from any project that uses javascript without requiring BeyondJS.

There are three types of widgets:

-   **Page:** Designed to create the different pages of the application, it receives configuration parameters associated with the URL and the use of layouts.
-   **Layout:** They represent page containers, that allow splitting code or logic that crosses pages. A layout can also contain another layout.
-   **Default:** They expose a web component under the defined name and do not require any additional treatment from BeyondJS.

All widgets implement a Controller object which is in charge of managing the lifecycle of the web component and allowing the definition of <Link to="/docs/widgets/docs/rendering">of rendering</Link>state, and navigation functionalities.

<Subtitle>Manual creation</Subtitle>

The manual configuration is done by adding the definition of the widget type bundle in the <Link to="/module/config">module.json</Link> of the module.

<Code>
{`
"widget": {
    "element": {
      "name": "web-login"
    },
    "ts": {
      "path": "/widget/ts",
      "files": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  }

`}

</Code>

The code above defines a bundle of type widget with the name of the web component as web login and with typescript as renderer.

<Subtitle>Creation with the dashboard</Subtitle>

All bundles can be created from the module creation form in the <Link to="/docs/dashboard">workspace</Link> By doing this, BeyondJS takes care of generating the necessary files and folder structure, including the Controller definition and the module.json and .tsconfig files.

When bundles are created through the dashboard, the files will be generated and modified by the development service.
