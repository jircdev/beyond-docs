Layouts are specialized widgets that represent containers for other widgets. They have multiple uses, such as sharing a graphical user interface design between different elements of a project or including code logic in multiple sections of the project. In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use Layouts in your BeyondJS project.

To set up a layout type widget, the "is" property must have the value `layout` in the file.

`module.json`.

<Code>
{`
"widget": {
    "is": "layout",
    "element": {
      "name": "main-layout"
    },
...
}
`}

</Code>

The "is" input is required for BeyondJS to identify existing layouts. From there, development is similar to any other widget.

The Layout Widget's controller object must extend from `[Library]WidgetController`, where `Library` should be replaced with the name of the widget library you are using.

Layouts can be used in two ways:

-   As a general layout for the entire project.
-   As a specific layout in page type widgets.

<Title tag="h2" text="Project Layout" />

The general project layout is defined by adding a "layout" entry point in the `package.json` file, which receives as value the name of the layout's web component, specified in the widget configuration when creating it (you can see it in the module.json file of the module).

> Projects created from the CLI or the <BeyondJS/> Workspace come with a configured project layout. The web component name is `main-layout` and it is located in the `modules/layouts/main` directory of the project.

The following is the minimum code for a layout

<Code>
    {`<main>
    <beyond-layout-children/>
</main>`}
</Code>
To specify where the rest of the project elements should be inserted in the layout, you must add the tag `<beyond-layout-children />

` in the desired place.

The web component `<beyond-layout-children/>` is handled by <BeyondJS/>
to determine where web components requested dynamically should be loaded.
If the project does not have a project layout, <BeyondJS/> automatically inserts
a `<beyond-layout-children/>` component in the `index.html` file to render
the rest of the project elements.

<Title tag="h2" text="Multiple Layouts" />

In <BeyondJS/> it is possible to handle multiple layouts and use them hierarchically,
where one layout can be contained by another. This allows for greater flexibility
when designing and structuring the graphical interface of your project.

> It is important to note that the general project layout cannot
> have a specified container layout. In this case, <BeyondJS/> will include the layout
> global project and ignore the instruction.

To add a layout as a container for a widget, you must include the "layout" entry
in the widget bundle configuration in the `module.json` file.

<CodeBox title="module.json">
    {` "widget": {
    "is": "page",
    "layout": "main-layout",
    "route": "/",
    "element": {
        "name": "home-page"
      }
}`}
</CodeBox>

> The value of the layout property must be the name of the web component, not the subpath of the module.
