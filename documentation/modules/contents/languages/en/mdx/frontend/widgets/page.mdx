<DocHeader pretitle="Widgets" title="Pages" />

Widgets of type 'page' represent a web page accessible by URL. <BeyondJS/> identifies and initializes them in the DOM when a URL request is received.

The 'page' bundle receives the following additional values in the configuration added in the 'module.json'

-   `is`: the value must be `page`.
-   `route`: Defines the route or url of the page and is explained in detail later.
-   `layout`: It is optional, it should be added if you want the page to be contained in a specific layout.

Based on the above, the following is an example of a valid 'module.json' for pages.

<CodeBox title="module.json">
{`{
  "name": "home",
  "widget": {
    "is": "page",
    "route": "/",
    "element": {
      "name": "home-page"
    },
    "ts": {
      "path": "ts",
      "files": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
`}

</CodeBox>

Pages must inherit from the `PageWidgetController` controller.

The `PageWidgetController` object manages the registration of URLs for handling <BeyondJS/> routing and is provided by the widget package used in the project.

> Page implementation is done through specific controllers for each library, such as `PageReactWidgetController` for React, `PageVueWidgetController` for Vue, and `PageSvelteWidgetController` for Svelte. These controllers are found in separate packages, which must be installed in the project according to the library being used. For example, to use page functionality in a React project, the package `@beyond-js/react-widgets` must be installed and the controller `PageReactWidgetController` used. This allows for greater flexibility and ease of use when adding support for new libraries in the future.

<Title tag="h2" text="Methods" />

The `PageWidgetController` contains the same methods as the `WidgetController` object, but also adds the following methods specific to page handling:

-   `hide` [void] [optional]: Executed when rendered and hidden, this occurs when navigating from one URL to another.
-   `show` [void] [optional]: Executed every time the URL is accessed and the page is displayed in the browser.

<Title tag="h2" text="Routing" />

As indicated at the beginning of the document, the page route is defined
by the `route` property of the widget, in the `module.json` file.

> The configurations of the `module.json` files are managed
> automatically by <BeyondJS/> when using tools such as the CLI
> or the BeyondJS Workspace.

URLs have a simple but powerful system for handling variables
that allow for working with dynamic URLs. All that is needed is
to define the variables that are expected to be received in the URL using
JavaScript's template-string syntax.

To illustrate this, let's say we have a page for modifying
user data and we need to handle the ID through the URL.

The route property of the widget would have the following value:

<Code>
    {`
/user/edit/\${userId}
`}
</Code>

The following URLs would match the created route:

-   `/user/edit/1`
-   `/user/edit/any-value`

Also, <BeyondJS/> provides an `uri` object as a property of the Controller and also,
this object is passed to the Render Component as `props`.

These properties, are available on the `uri` object available as a property in
the widget controller and could be accessed from the
controller in the following way:

<CodeBox title="controller.ts">{`this.uri.vars.get('userId');`}</CodeBox>

The way to access the uri object from the view components can vary
depending on the behavior of the libraries used.
