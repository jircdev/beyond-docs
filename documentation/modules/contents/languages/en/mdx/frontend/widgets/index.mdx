<DocHeader pretitle="Frontend" title="Widgets" />

The widgets of <BeyondJS/> are a key feature because they offer an easy and efficient way to implement solutions in <BeyondJS/> using your favorite library (such as React, Vue or Svelte) and provides a simple API for
integrating new existing libraries. This means that the learning curve is minimal
and is based on understanding the concept
of <ELink to="https://micro-frontends.org/">micro-frontends</ELink>.

Their architecture is designed to be directly compatible with
Micro frontends and load dependencies dynamically and on demand,
which optimizes load times, allows for a better user experience and
throughout the development process, as packages are not affected by their growth.

To achieve this, the Widgets are encapsulated
in <ELink to="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components </ELink> that use shadow DOM to encapsulate their content and can define
properties and methods that can be accessed through the DOM API.

These features are
combined with the possibility of integrating different technology stacks in the same project,
giving developers the ability to evaluate _what_ technology is more convenient
for developing specific functionality without having to think about _what_ technology to use
for an entire project.

Currently, <BeyondJS/> supports working with rendering libraries <ELink to="https://reactjs.org/">React</ELink>, <ELink to="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</ELink> and <ELink to="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</ELink>. It also allows for easy integration of new libraries or tools.

<Title tag="h2" text="Structure" />
Widgets in <BeyondJS /> are treated as a type of <Link href="/docs/modules/bundles">Bundle</Link>, which provides the
possibility to define the types of processors that should be included.

Their basic structure consists of the following elements:

-   `module.json`: Configuration file of the module/bundle, which can be generated automatically with the command `beyond add module`.
-   A Controller object that is responsible for registering the Widget in the DOM, mounting it and unmounting it. We will talk about it in more detail later.
-   Interface and logic files of the widget defined by the programmer, which can be created in React, Vue or Svelte.

<Title tag="h3" text="Types of Widgets" />
By default, there are three types of Widgets in <BeyondJS />:

-   Widget: It is the default widget, without a specific type.
    It simply represents a Micro frontend or Web Component with
    the ability to encapsulate its content and load it on demand.
-   Layout: They are containers of Pages and Widgets,

<Title tag="h2" text="Creating a Widget" />

In <BeyondJS />, you can create Widgets and any type of Bundle using the CLI (Command Line Interface) with the
command `beyondadd module`. To get more information about this process, we recommend you review
the <Link href="/docs/cli"> command section of the documentation </Link> of <BeyondJS />.

The structure of a page-type widget will be explained in detail below,
with a "Hello world", with the intention of having a concise and
fast understanding of the behavior and naturalness with which it is programmed in <BeyondJS/>. The code can be copied and pasted to see its behavior.

<Title tag="h4" text="ConfiguraciÃ³n" />

Widgets in <BeyondJS/> are defined by configuring the bundle in the module.json file, as shown below.

<CodeBox title="module.json">
{`{
    "widget": {
    "is": "page",
    "route": "/",
    "element": {
      "name": "home-page"
    },
    "ts": {
      "path": "ts",
      "files": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
`}

</CodeBox>

Widgets in <BeyondJS/> are defined by configuring the bundle in the `module.json` file, as shown below.

The `widget` bundle configuration structure is as follows:

-   `is`: Optional, should be added if you want to specify that the widget is of type `page` or `layout`.
-   `route`: To indicate the access URL.
-   `element`: Is an object that allows you to define the properties of the web component, this object can have the following entries:

    -   `attrs`: `strings[]`: Receives an array of strings with the attributes that you want to define in the web component.
    -   name: Name of the web component to create.

-   processors: Can receive as property any existing processor you want to use.

<Title tag="h4" text="Controller" />

The controller is responsible for defining which main object is going to be rendered and performing the necessary tasks to load our web component.

Example:

<CodeBox title="controller.ts">
{`import {PageReactWidgetController} from '@beyond-js/react-widgets/page';
import {View} from "./views";

export /*bundle*/
class Controller extends PageReactWidgetController {
    get Widget() {
        return View;
    }
}`}
</CodeBox>

The basic structure of a Page type widget is shown in the previous example, which mainly differs from the rest by the object from which the controller extends.

In the following, we explain in detail the important points:

-   Importing `PageReactWidgetController` from the <BeyondJS/> library,
    which provides controllers that manage the life cycle of the widgets.

-   The `getWidget` method is mandatory and must return the component or object
    that the widget is expected to render.

    It is important to keep in mind that the life cycle of a widget is composed
    of different phases such as loading, rendering and unloading, and the controller
    is in charge of handling these phases. Additionally, it is possible to have different types
    of controllers for different types of widgets.
    For more information on how the controller works,
    see the <Link href="/docs/widgets/controllers">Controller Object section</Link>
    in our documentation.

<Title tag="h4" text="View" />

In this example, it demonstrates how React is used and what is shown below is a typical component from this library.

<CodeBox title="./ts/view.tsx">
{`import * as React from "react";

export function View(props): JSX.Element {
    return (
        <main>
            <h1>Hola mundo</h1>
        </main>
    );
}
`}
</CodeBox>

In this example, the main component of the widget receives a set of properties that provide the developer with the necessary environment for a smooth and unobstructed development experience in projects with microfrontends of different natures that share information and project-specific elements.
