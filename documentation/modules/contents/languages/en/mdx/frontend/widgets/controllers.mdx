Controllers in <BeyondJS/> are responsible for managing the lifecycle of widgets. These allow creating a rich and appropriate ecosystem for the demands of current applications and provide an API that allows for simple configuration for sophisticated behaviors such as choosing the type of rendering to use, which can vary between Static Rendering, Client Rendering, or Server-side Rendering, also known as SSR.

BeyondJS provides base controllers for the different types of rendering, and these are extended by the packages that enable the possibility of working with rendering libraries.

> This document applies to any of the libraries, only the import and the exported controller name needs to be replaced, but the interface is the same. For convention and for the sake of simple understanding, the controllers of each package only add the library name as a prefix to the Controllers.

<Title tag="h2" text="WidgetController" />

> If you use the CLI or the Workspace to create your packages, the management of these dependencies is done automatically. This documentation is intended for the reader to understand the extendable way of <BeyondJS/>

To use the widgets of <BeyondJS/> it is necessary to have the package `@beyond-js/widgets` installed, and from there, install one of the following packages according to the library you want to use:

-   <ELink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beyond-js/react-widgets">`@beyond-js/react-widgets`</ELink>
-   <ELink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beyond-js/svelte-widgets">`@beyond-js/svelte-widgets`</ELink>
-   <ELink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beyond-js/vue-widgets">`@beyond-js/vue-widgets`</ELink>

<Title tag="h2" text="WidgetController" />

> `ReactWidgetController` in `react-widgets`.

> `VueWidgetController` in `vue-widgets`

> `SvelteWidgetController` in `svelte-widgets`.

La implementaci√≥n del controlador es requerida para el funcionamiento de los Widgets.
La estructura es la siguiente:

<Code>
{`
import {LibraryWidgetController} from '@beyond-js/kernel/library-widget/ts';
import {ObjectToRender} from './views/page';
export /*bundle*/
class Controller extends LibraryWidgetController {
    get Widget() {
        return ObjectToRender;
    }
}

`}

</Code>

The `Widget` getter must be defined and return a component to render, compatible
with the view library that is being used.

<Title tag="h4" text="Methods" />

-   `initialise` : Allows adding logic to be executed
    prior to web component mounting in the HTML DOM and executed only once.
-   `createStore` : Property required if SSR is to be implemented.
    Allows adding logic for handling the widget state,
    must return an object with
    the interface <Link href="/docs/api/IwidgetStore">IWidgetStore</Link>.

-   `mount`: It is similar to the initialise method, the difference is that this method is executed
    each time the component is mounted in the DOM, while the initialise method only
    executed at the time when the component is first mounted.

-   `unmount`: Allows executing logic when the component is going to be unmounted from the Document.
-   `disconnect`: It is the disconnect event of the Web Component, executed when the component is removed from the dom.
