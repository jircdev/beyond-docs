BeyondJS provides several rendering strategies to fit the needs of your project. Below are the rendering strategies available in BeyondJS and how to use them.

<Title tag="h2" text="CSR (Client Side Rendering)" />

Client Side Rendering (CSR) is a strategy in which the client's browser is responsible for generating the final view using JavaScript and is the default rendering type in <BeyondJS/>. This means that the page content is loaded dynamically in the browser, instead of being pre-generated on the server.

With this configuration, we are indicating that our widget will use Client Side Rendering. By default, the csr property has the value true, so it is not necessary to specify it if we want to use CSR rendering.

<Title tag="h2" text="SR (Static Rendering)" />

The SR (Static Rendering) strategy is a strategy in which there is already an HTML ready to be rendered, it is not necessary to interact with the server or with any framework since the resource being ready only needs to be requested.

To use this strategy, you must define a "render" property in the module.json file of your module, with the value of an array of strings containing each of the routes defined for each page or requested resource.

<CodeBox title="module.json">

{`{"widget": {

        "render": {
            "sr": [
                "/path/to/page1",
                "/path/to/page2"
            ]
        }
    }

}
`}

</CodeBox>

<Title tag="h2" text="SSR (Server Side Rendering)" />

The SSR (Server Side Rendering) rendering strategy in BeyondJS focuses on
generating the HTML of a component or widget on the server side before sending it to the client.
sending it to the client. This allows to load the data structure of the
component quickly and avoids the need for intervening packages,
dependencies or client-side frameworks to load it.

To enable SSR in a module or widget, an "ssr" property must be added in the bundle configuration (widget).
property must be added to the bundle (widget) configuration in the module's "module.json" file.
This property must be a boolean indicating whether server-side rendering is active.

In addition, it is necessary to define a "createStore" property in the view's Controller.
of the view. This property is a getter that returns an object of type IWidgetStore
which must contain three main methods:

-   `toJSON` : it is in charge of returning the data that the widget is going to consume from the server.
    This method is in charge of serializing the HTML response so that it can be sent to the client and displayed on the screen.
    and displayed on the screen.
-   hydrate`:It is in charge of hydrating or updating the HTML in the client.
    Its assumption is that the state previously rendered on the server
    matches the state to be returned to the client. This process is called hydrate and is
    responsible for synchronizing the client state with the server state.
-   fetch is used in both SSR and CSR (Client Side Rendering) strategies.

    Store data and making it available. This method is executed both on the client and on the server,
    depending on the strategy used. It is responsible for retrieving the necessary data
    to render the widget, either from the server or from the client.

<CodeBox title="module.json">
    {`{
    "widget": {
        "name": "mi-widget",
        "type": "page",
        "route": "/mi-pagina",
        "render": {
            "ssr": true
        }
    }

}`}

</CodeBox>

<Title tag="h2" text="Hybrid Rendering (SSR and CSR)" data-menu="Hybrid Rendering" />

BeyondJS allows you to use both client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR).
server-side rendering (SSR) together, which is known as hybrid rendering.

In this type of rendering, SSR is used to generate an initial HTML that is delivered to the client,
improving the page loading experience. Once the browser receives the initial HTML, the corresponding view framework is responsible for updating and handling the rendered HTML.
framework takes care of updating and handling the view based on user interaction.

To enable hybrid rendering in a BeyondJS widget, we must define in the module's `module.json` a render property, which is an object with three possible inputs:

<CodeBox title="module.json">
    {`{
    "widget": {
        "render": {
            "ssr": true,
            "csr": true
        }
    }
}`}

</CodeBox>
