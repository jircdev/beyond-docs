<Title>State management</Title>

State represents the values rendered by a component or widget on the screen.
It can change and vary due to various factors, such as updating data from a server or user interaction.

There are numerous libraries for managing the state of a project, generally associated with the <Link href="/docs/widgets">view framework</Link> being used. BeyondJS allows integrating the desired state management tool, as long as it is prepared for modular operation.

You can see a functional example of a counter that shares state management between a component created with **React**, one created with **Svelte** and one with **Vue** in <Link href="/examples/sm/counter">This example.</Link>

Also, BeyondJS defines a structure for state management.
The object that manages the state must be made available through the createWidgetStore method of the widget controller.
This method must return an object that implements the <Link href="/api/IWidgetStore">IWidgetStore</Link> interface,
essentially if working with ssr is expected.
