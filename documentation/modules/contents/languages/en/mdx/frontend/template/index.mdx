BeyondJS provides a simple but robust architecture for managing templates in projects, which has the following features:

-   **Styles:** Integrated support for LESS and SASS preprocessors.
-   **CSS Properties:** Basic variable structure that allows for efficient web component work.
-   **Global style:** Global stylesheet for the project.
-   **Overwriting:** This is a special feature that allows for redefining styles and texts of existing modules without having to touch the original code.
-   **Code separation:** Independent management of style files with automated process for generating independent and optimized final files.
-   **Light & Dark Theme** built in.

The template configuration, like all elements in BeyondJS, is handled through a configuration file, whose name, by convention, is template.json and is located in the template folder in the root of the project. However, both the name and location are configurable values in the <Link href="/project/config">project.json.</Link>

The template can be managed from the <Link href="/docs/workspace">Workspace</Link> and when a project is created, the default structure is already configured for its management.

Below are the configuration properties explained

The application and global properties receive the same configuration parameters, but they have different purposes.

<Title tag="h4" txt="template.application" />

The application configuration property represents the general styles file of the project and its main focus is to be the place where custom CSS properties and any styles that need to be applied to the general document, external to the widgets, are defined.

**Custom properties** play an important role in managing the widgets. Web components with Shadow DOM are not affected by the general styles of the website where they are included. However, CSS properties can be accessed and used.

Handling styles can be seen in detail in the <Link href="/docs/styles/template">Styles in the template</Link> section.

<Title tag="h4" txt="template.global" />

It aims to provide the developer with the possibility of sharing code between widgets. The files added in the global configuration are compiled into a file named global.css, which is included in the shadow dom of each widget so they have access to the styles.

<Code>
    {`
"application": {
    "processor": "sass",
    "path": "application",
    "files": [
      "*"
    ]
},
"global": {
    "processor": "sass",
    "path": "application",
    "files": [
      "*"
    ]
  }
  `}
</Code>

As it can be seen in the above code, the configuration of both properties works the same, they receive an object with the following properties:

-   **processor:** Processor to use. It supports sass and less
-   **path:** Directory where the files are located, if not defined it will look for all files relative to the location of the configuration file.
-   **files:** The \* indicates that any file inside the defined path should be taken into account. If files are specified by name, only the indicated files will be taken into account.
