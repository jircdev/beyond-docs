BeyondJS has simple yet powerful path handling. For most of the cases,
URLs can be defined in the configuration of the `module.json` file.

<Link href="/widgets/pages">widgets of type page</Link>, via the URL property, but there may be cases where some more
advanced configuration is required.

> Note: This section covers the documentation of the routing object. If you want to learn about handling parameters in the url of a page,

<Title tag="h2" text="Object `routing`" />

The `routing` object manages the browser history and is responsible for handling compatibility for web and mobile projects.
It offers an API that allows you to work with the history and manipulate it.

It is made available by the `@beyond-js/kernel` package and is imported as follows:

<Code>
{`
import {routing}  from   "@beyond-js/kernel/routing";
`}

</Code>

The `routing` object in <BeyondJS/> exists to cover the following scenarios:

-   To provide the programmer with a simple API for complex URL handling, such as validations, redirections, and variable management.
-   To identify the user's navigation flow and history within the application. The browser's history object has a very limited treatment of this and only allows access to the number of existing navigations. BeyondJS, on the other hand, manages a detailed history.
-   Because hybrid applications made with JavaScript handle file management through a protocol different from applications accessed from a browser, <BeyondJS /> handles this to abstract the programmer from it and ensure the same behavior regardless of the platform being worked on.

<Title tag="h2" text="Navegación" />

In order to maintain compatibility with known APIs, the Routing object has analogous methods to the methods of the browser's history API and basically cover the same needs, but at the same time, they are responsible for unifying behaviors between platforms and updating the elements of BeyondJS's history.

The available methods are:

**routing.pushState**

Registra un nuevo elemento en el histórico

<Code>
    {`
routing.pushState('/home', [{state}]);
`}
</Code>

**routing.replaceState**

Records a new item in the history.

<Code>
    {`
routing.replaceState('/home', [{state}]);
`}
</Code>

It has the same interface as the pushState method of the history object of the Web API and
additionally it is responsible for updating BeyondJS's history.

<Subtitle>Route Overriding</Subtitle>

**routing.redirect**

Generally, although there may be more, there are two typical contexts in which
it is necessary to handle URLs:

-   When friendly URLs are required.
-   When it is necessary to validate access permissions and, in case the person trying to enter the
    URL does not have them, try to redirect to a specific flow.

For these cases, an asynchronous function `redirect`
can be defined as a property of the routing object. This function receives an object
of type <Link href="/api/uri">{`<URI>`}</Link> which has a pathname property
which represents the current route.

The redirect function can return undefined or a string. If it returns undefined the navigation flow will continue without interruption. If a string is returned, it will be taken
as the final URL and BeyondJS will redirect to the returned URL.

<Code>
{`
routing.redirect = async function redirect(uri): Promise[string] {
	return '/';
};

`}

</Code>

In the previous example, any received route is redirected to /.

<Subtitle>Handling of not found URLs.</Subtitle>

The routing object has a `missing` property that can be defined as an asynchronous function
and returns the name of the widget you want to display if the requested URL is not found.

A typical use case is wanting to implement a 404 screen for a page not found.

A basic implementation can be as follows:

<Code>
{`
routing.missing = async (pathname: String) => {
   return 'app-docs-missing';
}

`}

</Code>

In the previous example, the name of a widget is being returned, BeyondJS will validate that the widget exists when the URL is not found and will display it as an error page.
