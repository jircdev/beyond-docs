<DocHeader pretitle="Frontend" title="Template System" />

BeyondJS has a powerful templating system that allows you to define general styles for the project,
share styles and functions between components and components and customize the behavior of modules.
This is defined in a "template.json" file with three main entry points: "application", "gloal" and "overwrites".

This system is flexible and versatile, allowing an efficient management of the styles and behaviors of the application's styles and behaviors.

The above configuration is the default configuration for web project templates. The Sass processor is being configured for the application and global templates, and the purpose of each will be explained below.

The configuration of template elements resembles the configuration of processors in bundles. Each element can have the following properties:

-   **processor:** Processor to be used. Supports `sass` and `less`.
-   **path:** Directory where the files are located. If not defined, all files relative to the location of the configuration file will be searched.
-   **Files:** The indicates that all files within the defined path are to be taken into account. If specific file names are specified, only those specified will be included.

> It is assumed on this page that the template is located in a folder with its name at the root of the project. If a change was made to the default configuration, it is important to keep track of the configured location.

The `styles.css` file is included in web platform projects as a property called `application`.
a property called "application". This property is used to add
general styles to the page and define <ELink to="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*"> custom properties properties</ELink> that will be available in all components.

The **custom properties** are unique style values that can be shared between components due to their integration into due to their integration into web components with Shadow DOM.

The default configuration for styles in `template.application` includes all `.scss` files present in the `./template/application` directory within the project.

The following are the included files:

-   `./variables.scss`: Contains a list of default Sass variables.
-   ./styles.scss`: Contains basic styles for the body of the document.
-   `./custom-properties/dark.scss`: Provides a mixin that defines the variables to be used in the dark style.
-   `./custom-properties/light.scss`: Provides a mixin that defines the variables to be used in the light style.
-   `./custom-properties/material-design.scss`: Includes the CSS properties of the Material Design color system.
-   `./custom-properties/definition.scss`: Includes the definition of the custom CSS properties that integrate the use of the mixins defined in `dark.scss` and `light.scss`.

Programmers can edit or add any additional style file, which will be automatically integrated thanks to the addition of a `"*"` character in the configuration indicating that all files in the folder should be processed.

<Title tag="h4" text="`template.global`" />

The global property is represented in the `global.css` file, whose purpose is to share styles considered global among all widgets. To achieve this, the final file is included within the styles of each widget.

By default, all the files found in the `/global` folder are included, and by default only one file is included: `styles.scss`.
