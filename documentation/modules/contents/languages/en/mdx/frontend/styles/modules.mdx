Adding styles to a module/bundle requires the use of SASS as <Link href="/docs/processors">processor</Link>. In a project created with workspace, SASS is included by default in the code and widget bundles. The standard SASS configuration is:

<Title tag="h2" text="`module.json`" />

<Code>
{`
{
    ...
    "sass": {
        "path": "sass",
        "files": ["*"]
    },
    ...
}

`}

</Code>

The configuration indicates that in the module there is a sass folder, located relative to the `module.json` file and that all its files are considered styles. The bundle with the processor inserts the styles in the DOM during rendering, avoiding the need to make external imports in the JavaScript code.
