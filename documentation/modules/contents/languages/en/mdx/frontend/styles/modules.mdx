To add styles in a created module/bundle, the <Link href="/docs/processors">SASS processor</Link> must be added.

If the workspace is used for project creation, the SASS processor is included by default in code and widget bundles of any type.

The standard configuration of a SASS processor is the following:

**module.json**

<Code>
{`
{
    ...
    "sass": {
        "path": "sass",
        "files": ["*"]
    },
    ...
}

`}

</Code>

In the above configuration, it is being defined that in the module there is a sass folder, with a location relative to the module.json file and that all files in this folder must be taken into account as style files.

The processor's container bundle is responsible for inserting the styles into the DOM when the element is rendered, in this way, it is not required to make external file imports with JavaScript semantics in our code.
