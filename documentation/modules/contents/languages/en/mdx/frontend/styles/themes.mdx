<BeyondJS /> provides a simple mechanism to support light and dark themes consisting of two parts.

-   Styles template
-   `data-beyond-mode` attribute.

<Title tag="h2" text="Themes in the template" />

The application template is configured to support both the
Light and Dark themes and provides a custom style definition file for each theme.

In the `definition.scss` file, the following code is found:

<CodeBox title="definition.scss">
{`
@use 'dark';
@use 'light';
:root {
  @include light.properties();
  @media(prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    @include dark.properties();
  }
}

html[data-beyond-mode="light"] {
@include light.properties();
}

html[data-beyond-mode="dark"] {
@include dark.properties();
}

`}

</CodeBox>

The above code makes the configuration variables for the dark and light themes available in the corresponding files.

<Title tag="h2" text=":host-context" />

In most cases, if a component requires knowledge of the
theme in use, you can use the `:host-context` selector in a style file to define it, such as
style file to define it, as illustrated in the following example:

<Code>
{`
:host-context(html[data-beyond-mode]) {
    //styles here...
}

`}

</Code>

> ::host-context is a CSS selector that allows selecting an element based on the context of the host element.
> It enables setting styles on an element that depends on its context on the page,
> instead of its own content or structure.
> It is used with the syntax :host-context(selector).

In some cases, components may require dynamically knowing the theme change. In these cases, the widgets object API can be used.

<Code>
{`
import { widgets } from '@beyond-js/widgets/render';

widgets.attributes.add('data-beyond-mode', theme);
`}

</Code>

The previous line adds to all existing widgets the attribute `data-beyond-mode` with the value dark.
