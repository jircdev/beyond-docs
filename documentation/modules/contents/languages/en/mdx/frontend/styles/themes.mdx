<Title>Light & Dark theme</Title>

BeyondJS provides a simple mechanism to support light and dark theme, which consists of two parts.

-   The style template.
-   data-beyond-mode attribute.

Themes in the template.

The application template is already configured to support the light and dark theme and provides a custom css property definition file for each theme. Then, in the definition.scss file you have the following code:

**definition.scss**

<Code>
{`
@use 'dark';
@use 'light';
:root {
  @include light.properties();
  @media(prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    @include dark.properties();
  }
}

html[data-beyond-mode="light"] {
@include light.properties();
}

html[data-beyond-mode="dark"] {
@include dark.properties();
}

`}

</Code>

The previous code makes the variables configured in the dark and light files available for each respective theme.

In most cases, if a widget requires validating the theme that is being used, it may suffice to use the host-context selector to define it from a style file, as shown in the following example:

<Code>
{`
:host-context(html[data-beyond-mode]) {
    //styles here...
}

`}

</Code>

There are some cases where it may be necessary for the widgets to dynamically know about the theme change, for this, the widgets object api can be used.

<Code>
{`
:host-context(html[data-beyond-mode]) {
    //styles here...
}

`}

</Code>

The above line adds the data-beyond-mode attribute with the value dark to all existing widgets.
