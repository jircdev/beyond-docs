Now, let's create a new page to which the client will be redirected after logging in.

<Title tag="h2" text="Redirection Module" />
From the console, located in the root folder of the project, we will run the module creation command again:

<Code>beyond add module</Code>

We will add the following values in the command console:

-   **Package subpath**: we will name it "welcome".
-   **Package type** : we will select "page".
-   **web component name**: we will put `app-welcome`. Web component names must contain
    two words and be separated by dashes.
-   **page url**: we add "/welcome"
-   **About**: Welcome page
-   **styles**: we indicate yes.
-   **multilanguage**: we indicate no.

In the next step, we will head over to the view file of the module (`welcome/ts/views/index.tsx`)
and in the component's return statement, add a "Welcome!" message with the desired styling.

<Title tag="h2" text="Navigation" />

Get ready to make a big leap in your application by redirecting to your welcome
module after login! The first thing we need to do is to import the "routing" object from
`@beyond-js/kernel` package,
so we can use the powerful pushState method that will allow us to navigate to the welcome page.

<CodeBox title="home/views/index.tsx">{`import { routing } from '@beyond-js/kernel/routing';`}</CodeBox>

And in the `onSubmit` function, we will add the following line so that everything works perfectly:

<Code>{`routing.pushState('/welcome');`}</Code>

Thus, our `onSubmit` function would look like this:

<CodeBox title="home/views/index.tsx">
{`const onSubmit = async (event) => {
        try {
            event.preventDefault();
            const response = await model.login(username, password);

            if (!response.data?.valid) {
                setError(response.error);
                return;
            }
            routing.pushState('/welcome');
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
        }
    };

`}

 </CodeBox>

With these simple steps, you will redirect your users to the welcome page. BeyondJS also manages the user's browsing history, providing advanced management functionalities beyond the browser's API.

Imagine having access to previous page logs at any time! BeyondJS gives you full control over the user's browsing experience, enabling you to identify these logs and access them whenever you need to.

Now it is necessary to reload the page for testing, this is because the application urls are
registered at the beginning of the project load.

If we test our form we will be able to see that an error appears if the data is invalid and that
it starts and redirects to our welcome screen if the data entered is correct.

With this last step, we end the complete tutorial, which consisted of 4 fundamental parts:

-   In the first part, we dealt with starting and installing the project and creating the main package.
-   In the second part, we showed how to create the first module and how to use it in the application.
-   In the third part, it was explained how to create a bridge in the backend to connect through a WebSocket connection and integrate it from the backend.
    WebSocket connection and integrate it from the client.
-   Finally, in the fourth part, it was demonstrated how to use the
    routing object of <BeyondJS /> to navigate to a new page.

In addition, there are some additional points worth noting:

-   The modules created are standalone bundles and no packers are required to use them.
-   A WebSocket connection between client and server was implemented with a typed API that verifies that the methods and parameters passed match the
    and parameters passed match their definition in the backend.
-   The magic comment `/*bundle*/` was used to define which object should be exposed to be consumed in another bundle.
-   The magic comment `/*actions*/` was used in the bridge bundle to define that the object should generate a client api, which should be consumed in another bundle.
    a client api, which is handled by <BeyondJS/> automatically.
-   The created code can be packaged for a hybrid application.
