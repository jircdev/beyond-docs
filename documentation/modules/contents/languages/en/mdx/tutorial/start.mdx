To run this tutorial you need:

-   To have Node.js 16.x installed.
-   have basic knowledge of the command console.

Additionally, it is recommended to use <ELink href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vscode</ELink> to follow the tutorial step by step.
to follow the tutorial step by step. However any other editor can be used.

<Title tag="h2" text="Getting started" />

The first thing we will do is to create our project. To do this we must open the command console
in the folder where we want and execute the following command:

<Code>npx @beyond-js/create-package</Code>

This command is interactive and will request some data to define our package or project.
The data requested are the following:

-   Package specifier: It corresponds to the name of our package, for the purposes of this tutorial
    our package will be called: 'beyond-web-tutorial'.
-   Package type: It corresponds to the type of project to create, we will select `web-backend` which contains
    the packages to implement a connection between a node service and our web project through websockets,
    as we will see later.
    OndJS locally and generate the initial structure of our project.
-   It will ask if we want to install the dependencies, we select yes.

Ready! our project has been created. Next we will open our text editor in the directory
directory where we execute the command

<Code>code .</Code>

When we open it we can see that we have the following structure:

-   **beyond.json:** File to manage the development server, managed by BeyondJS.
-   **packages.json:** This file records the projects that the DevServer has access to,
    usually managed directly by <BeyondJS/>.
-   **beyond-js-tutorial**: The folder of our package and project.

    -   **package.json**: javascript package file.
    -   **/modules:** Folder where the modules of the project are created by default. This value is configurable, you can read more about it in the <Link href="/docs/projects/json">Project Configuration section.</Link>.
    -   **template:** This folder contains all the elements needed to define the overall project template.

        -   **template.json:** File that allows you to make adjustments to the project template configuration.

> If you wish you can learn about the differences between project types
> in <Link href="/docs/packages/types"> the corresponding section of the documentation.</Link>.

Next, we must start <BeyondJS/>, for this we run the following command:

<Code language="shel">beyond run</Code>

When executed, the following message should appear in the command console:

```
Follow the link to manage your packages with the workspace:
https://workspace.beyondjs.com?port=4000

```

Done! We can now access our project at <ELink href="http://localhost:6500/">http://localhost:6500/</ELink>.

Next we are going to create our first module.
