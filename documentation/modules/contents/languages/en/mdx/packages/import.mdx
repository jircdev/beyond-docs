In BeyondJS a project can be imported by another project and function as a library, giving the main project access to its modules. This functionality is key to think of solutions with interconnected microservice structures or libraries containing reusable code.

For example, we can talk about a solution that manages a web page, a mobile application and an administrative panel, all as independent projects that feed the same data source. The import of projects allows all the data logic to be managed in an independent project that is used by the three applications, thus allowing the code to be reused.

The import of projects is done from the <Link href="/docs/projects/json">project.json</Link> and it is necessary that the projects are added in the projects entry of the beyond.json.

If the projects are created via the Workspace, the beyond.json file is automatically modified.

Following the above example, the project with the modules that manage the data and connect to the database could be called models and in order to import it into the other projects, the following code would have to be added in the project.json

<Code>
{`
"libraries": {
    "imports": [
      "@project/models"
    ]
}

`}

</Code>

The imports property receives an array of items, allowing multiple projects to be imported if required.
