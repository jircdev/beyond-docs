<DocHeader id="intro" pretitle="Packages" title="Distributions" />

Distributions are a functionality that allows you to define the behavior that the BeyondJS DevServer should have in the development environment and the features for the packaging of the project during the deployment process.

> When a new project is created, it comes with a distribution configured by default. This document describes in detail all the distribution configuration options needed to work with different runtime environments or module resolution types.

<Title id="definition" tag="h2" text="Definition" />

The distributions are defined in the `project.json` file, in the `distirbutions` property of the `development` entry point.
property of the `development` entry point.

An example of a distribution is:

<Code>
	{` 
{
    "name": "web",
    "platform": "web",
    "environment": "development",
    "ports": {
        "bundles": 3500
    }
}
`}
</Code>

<Title id="properties" tag="h2" text="Properties" />

-   <ObjectProperty type="string">name</ObjectProperty> Name identifier of the distribution.
-   <ObjectProperty type="string">platform</ObjectProperty> identifier of the platform used by the distribution.
    You can see the platform identifiers in the <Link href="/platforms">platforms section</Link>.

-   <ObjectProperty type="string">environment</ObjectProperty> supports `deployment` and `production`
    values.

    -   <ObjectProperty type="object">ports</ObjectProperty> receives an object with the following properties
        :
    -   <ObjectProperty type="number">bundles</ObjectProperty> port on which the DevServer will return
        bundles.
    -   <ObjectProperty type="number">http</ObjectProperty> port to connect debuggers or code inspectors.

> You can read more about remote inspection in <Link href="/remote-inspection">remote-inspection section.</Link>

-   <ObjectProperty type="object">ts</ObjectProperty> Object handled to manage typescript compiler configurations,
    currently supports the following properties:

    -   <ItemProperty type="string" optional label="compiler">
        	accepts `ts` and `transpiler` values.
        </ItemProperty>

-   <ItemProperty type="string" optional label="backend">
    	This property is required if the package uses a connection to a backend via websockets. You
    	can read more about this in the <Link href="/bridges">Bridges</Link> section.
    </ItemProperty>

<Title tag="h4" text="Web Packages" />

The web distribution is configured to handle web, mobile or desktop projects.

<CodeBox title="package.json">
	{`  "deployment": {
    "distributions": [
       {
        "name": "web",
        "platform": "web",
        "environment": "development",
        "ports": {
          "bundles": 6500
        }
      }
    ]
  }`}
</CodeBox>

<Title tag="h4" text="Backend Packages" />

You can create backend projects with three types of platforms **node**, **deno** and **backend**.

All represent a script that can be executed as a service in a Node or Deno execution environment (the platform defined for each case must be used).

<BeyondJS /> uses the platform to identify how the code should be packaged.

> The backend distribution in BeyondJS is a Node.js service that allows connecting to other services or clients through WebSockets.
> Thanks to bridge bundles, the development of backend functionality is facilitated by automatically generating an API with data typing and HMR support in development environments. This gives programmers the ability to easily create and consume methods defined in the backend.

The configuration of these distributions is done as follows, taking into account that the values such as "name" and configuration ports are defined by the developer and that the value of the platform will depend on the purpose of the package and the environment to be used. on the purpose of the package and the environment to be used.

<CodeBox title="package.json">
	{`  "deployment": {
    "distributions": [
      {
        "name": "backend",
        "platform": "backend",
        "environment": "development",
        "ports": {
          "bundles": 6580,
          "http": 6581,
          "inspect": 6582
        }
      }
    ]
  }`}
</CodeBox>

<Title tag="h4" text="Web and Backend Configuration" />

In projects where client and server interaction is required, you can add the configuration of both distributions and interact simultaneously with the <BeyondJS/> Dev Server to have an efficient and homogeneous experience in the development.

To do this, it is necessary to add both distributions and specify **in the web distribution the property "backend" that must have as value the name that has been placed to the backend distribution**.

<CodeBox title="package.json">
	{`"deployment": {
    "distributions": [
      {
        "name": "web",
        "platform": "web",
        "environment": "development",
        "backend": "backend",
        "ports": {
          "bundles": 6510
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "backend",
        "platform": "backend",
        "environment": "development",
        "ports": {
          "bundles": 6511,
          "http": 6512,
          "inspect": 6513
        }
      }
    ]
  }
`}
</CodeBox>

<Title tag="h3" text="Module resolution format" />

The module resolution format in <BeyondJS/> is automatically set based on the distribution type. However, developers can modify them according to their needs by adding the 'bundles' property in the distribution configuration.

The 'bundles' property is an object that includes a 'mode' property, whose value determines the type of module resolution.

The accepted values for 'mode' are: 'amd', 'sjs', 'esm', 'cjs'.

Example:

<CodeBox title="package.json">
	{`  "deployment": {
    "distributions": [
      {
        "name": "web",
        "platform": "web",
        "bundles": {
            "mode": "esm"
        },
        "ports": {
          "bundles": 6580
        }
      }
    ]
  }`}
