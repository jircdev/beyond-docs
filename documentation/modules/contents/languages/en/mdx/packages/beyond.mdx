> BeyondJS is a highly extensible platform, designed to allow developers to integrate the technologies that best suit their needs, including new ones that emerge in the market. This means that developers can create custom packages to extend existing <BeyondJS/> functionality. If you want to learn more about how to extend BeyondJS, you can visit the <Link href="/docs/foundations/extend">relevant section in our documentation</Link>.

<BeyondJS /> offers a variety of standalone packages so that they can be incorporated into development as needed. This
provides greater flexibility and adaptability in the creation of projects, allowing you to choose which technologies and
libraries that best suit the needs of the project. In addition, this allows for greater scalability as packages can be
scalability as packages can be upgraded or replaced independently. You can read more about about these packages in the
Available Packages section.

This document will review what each of the packages does.

<Title tag="h3" text="@beyond-js/kernel" />

This package contains a set of essential utility functionalities for developing projects in <BeyondJS />.

<Title tag="h3" text="@beyond-js/backend" />

This package provides a node-based backend service with Websocket connection and supports the execution of Bridges, a BeyondJS functionality that allows creating backend APIs and the client code to consume it with data typing included.

<Title tag="h3" text="@beyond-js/bee" />
This package enhances the Node.js development experience by allowing you to interact with the <BeyondJS /> DevServer instead
of searching for packages on disk. This allows programming with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) functionalities in a natural
and easy way. In addition, it provides support for working with http imports in older versions of Node.js.
<Title tag="h3" text="@beyond-js/local" />
This package is used for two main functions:

It listens for changes from the BeyondJS Inspector and performs immediate loading via HMR of the modified elements. It is used for backend projects, checking the status of the launchers and turning them on prior to the execution of the action. Enables HMR behavior in projects made with <BeyondJS/>. It is a required dependency for the development environment.

<Title tag="h3" text="@beyond-js/ssr" />

BeyondJS implements Server Side Rendering (SSR) via an HTTP server with three endpoints: widget and page. It allows you to implement SSR solutions in web projects. You can read more about best practices and other forms of rendering in <Link href="/docs/widgets/rendering"> the Rendering with Widgets section</Link>.

<Title tag="h3" text="@beyond-js/widgets" />

Web projects or packages in <BeyondJS/> function as standalone microfrontends with the ability to contain their own stack of technologies. These projects are flexible and easily extensible, allowing the integration of new widget packages that provide support for view or rendering libraries with a few simple steps.

<BeyondJS /> focuses on making it easy to integrate new rendering libraries, so you can do it easily. You can read more
about adding rendering engines in the corresponding section of the documentation.

In addition, <BeyondJS/> offers the following specific packages for creating Web projects with client, static or server-side rendering (SSR) using <ELink hef="https://reactjs.org/">React</ELink>, <ELink href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</ELink> and <ELink href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</ELink>.

These packages are:

-   React: `@beyond-js/react-widgets`.
-   Svelte: `@beyond-js/svelte-widgets`
-   Vue: `@beyond-js/vue-widgets`
