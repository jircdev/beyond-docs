In <BeyondJS/> projects or applications are handled as a javascript package that can be published to NPM directly if desired.

The `package.json` file has a similar function to that of any npm project,
in that it is where the project dependencies and settings are defined. However, <BeyondJS/> adds a set of additional entry points
to the package.json, which allow developers to manage packages universally and then be able to run and publish them on any platform.
on any platform.

In summary, the package.json in BeyondJS is a fundamental file for project configuration and management.
In addition to the common functions of a package.json, BeyondJS adds additional entry points that allow you to manage packages universally,
define distributions, specify package paths, configure templates, set supported languages and define global project parameters.

Packages in <BeyondJS/> can be created in three ways:

-   By running the `beyond add package` command in the command console
-   Using the BeyondJS Workspace.
-   Manually.

<Title tag="h3" text="Creating using the CLI" />

To Create a project using the cli you only need to execute the following command:

<Code>beyond add package</Code>

> To make use of the <BeyondJS/> CLI you must have <BeyondJS/> installed globally. You can see all the commands provided
> in <Link href="/docs/cli">the cli</Link> section of this documentation.

<Title tag="h3" text="Creation using BeyondJS Workspace" />

You can create packages directly from the BeyondJS Workspace, to do so you must follow the steps below:

-   Run <BeyondJS/> in the folder you want to manage your projects.
-   Access <ELink href="https://workspace.beyondjs.com"> https://workspace.beyondjs.com</ELink> and create the project through its graphical interface.

> You can read more about how the Workspace works in the <Link href="/docs/workspace">BeyondJS Workspace</Link> section.

<Title tag="h3" text="Manual creation" />

You can create the packages manually, for this you only have to create a package.json with its minimal structure, which must include
the package name.

<Code name="package.json">
	{`
{
    "name": "package-name",
}`}
</Code>

In addition, you will need to create the `beyond.json` file so that the <BeyondJS/> DevServer can recognize it. The file must have the following structure

<CodeBox title="beyond.json">
	{`
{
    "applications": ["./project.json"]
}`}
</CodeBox>

> You can create the package.json with third party tools like NPM or Yarn, then register them in the `beyond.json` file. You must make sure
> that you have the package properties that <BeyondJS/> requires.
> Además, tendrás que crear el archivo `beyond.json` para que el DevServer de <BeyondJS/> pueda reconocerlo. El archivo debe tener la siguiente estrucutra
