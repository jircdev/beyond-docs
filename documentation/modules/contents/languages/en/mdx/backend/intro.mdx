With <BeyondJS/>, developing packages, applications or backend libraries for Deno,
Node or Bun is a simple and powerful task. <BeyondJS/> allows you to work naturally and without major
without major configurations to create code with functionality for each platform and distribute it easily.
platform and distribute it with ease.

You don't need third-party tools,
because <BeyondJS/> works directly on Node.js and NPM standards,
generating the final code to be consumed by module resolution standards such as ESM, CJS, CJS
module standards such as ESM, CJS, AMD or SJS. With <BeyondJS/> you will have complete control
over your code and you will be able to distribute it more efficiently.

To create a package that can be executed in an engine such as Node or Deno,
you only need to specify in the
`package.json` the corresponding distribution.

<CodeBox title="package.json" language="json">

{`"deployment": {
    "distributions": [
      {
        "name": "init-backend",
        "environment": "development",
        "platform": "backend",
        "ports": {
          "bundles": "7070",
          "http": "7073",
          "inspect": "7072"
        }

This code configures the DevServer to execute the code of a Node or Bun service in development environment.
Node or Bun service in development environment. Some details are explained below:

-   The 'backend' value of 'platform' indicates that this is code that will be executed in backend code environments
    backend code environments such as Node or Bun,
    as well as being compatible with Deno through additional configurations.
-   The 'ports' entry defines three ports values, including the port
    port `bundles` which is used by the DevServer to return packets when required by the execution environment, and
    the runtime environment requires them, and the `inspect` port which allows debugging tools such as debug to be used.
    debugging tools such as the VSCode debugger or browsers such as Chrome or Edge.
    This is essential for working efficiently with HMR, one of the most powerful features of <BeyondJS/>.

<Title tag="h2" text="Packaging format" />

Although the development experience for the
programmer is the standard EcmaScript Modules (ESM),
BeyondJS DevServer generates the bundles for Backend platforms in the CommonJS format.
Backend platforms in the CommonJS format by default.
This is due to the large number of bundles that use this format and that Node
this format and because Node.js does not yet provide full support for the Ecma
support for EcmaScript formatted code.

However, modifying the packaging format is extremely easy.
extremely simple. You just need to add a
"bundles" property in the distribution to indicate the way in which the bundles are expected to be
you expect the bundles to be generated.

For example, if you want to work with Deno and you want the bundles
bundles of your package can be consumed with "http imports",
you just need to add the following entry point to the distribution in the package.json
distribution in the package.json:

<Code language="json">

{`"bundles": {
    "mode": "esm"
}`}

</Code>

With this setting in the `package.json`, the DevServer will automate the process of packaging the
packaging of the code without the need to restart any service,
since it does it in real time.

<CodeBox title="package.json" language="json">

{`"deployment": {
    "distributions": [
      {
        "name": "init-backend",
        "environment": "development",
        "platform": "backend",
        "bundles": {
            "mode": "esm"
        }
        "ports": {
          "bundles": "7070",
          "http": "7073",
          "inspect": "7072"
        }
      }
    ]
  }`}

</CodeBox>

Thus, the distribution in the `package.json` would look like this:
In addition, the DevServer of <BeyondJS/>
DevServer offers the possibility to set up multiple distributions
and test the packaging of the code simultaneously,
which is highly efficient in terms of time and productivity for developers looking to create
for developers looking to create packages that are consumed by any environment (including
by any environment (as well as those who don't!).
