Bridges in BeyondJS are a powerful tool that
allows you to optimize your development to the maximum.

A bridge is a special type of Bundle that allows you to create code on the server-side that BeyondJS generates in
server-side code and BeyondJS automatically generates an API mode object.
API mode object. This way, you can consume the exported methods remotely via websockets.
remotely via websockets.

You can import the bundle from another service or from a code
client code and have direct access to the defined methods, with built-in data typing and
data typing and validations built in. This means that you only need to
only need to write the code once, saving you time and effort in your
time and effort in your development.

Are you ready to get the most out of BeyondJS and optimize your projects with bridges?
Here we'll show you a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a bridge
step-by-step tutorial to create a bridge and export your methods easily and quickly!
and fast!

To give context to the process, let's imagine that you are
coding in a package whose name is "awesome-api".

1. Make sure you are in the root of your project at the level of the `package.json` file.
   `package.json`.

2. Open the terminal and execute the command `beyond add module`.

    This command is interactive, which means that it requires a > console with interactive capabilities for its correct execution.

    > console with interactive functionalities for its correct execution.
    > If you do not have an interactive console, it is recommended to > create the module using the Workspace.
    > create the module using the <BeyondJS/> Workspace or.
    > manually <Link href="/docs/modules/creation">following the steps detailed in the documentation.</Link>.

3. The command will prompt for the subpath, this is the name of the module
   which will be used to export it later.
4. select `bridge` as the type of bundle to create.

Once created, open the `.ts` file of the module and create the object with the methods you want to export.
object with the methods you want to export.
In order for <BeyondJS/> to generate the client-side bridge you must
export the object by adding the
magic /\*bundle\*/ after the "exports" keyword.

Your bridge code should look similar to the following:

<CodeBox title="bridge.ts">
	{`export /*actions*/ /*bundle*/ class Auth {
    // m√©todos y definiciones
}`}
</CodeBox>

In the example code, we show how to export a class to be instantiated as a bridge.
instantiated as a bridge. However, it is possible to export an already instantiated
object or a flat object directly as a bridge.
This is done by adding the corresponding magic comments
(/\*bundle\*/ /\*actions\*/) to the export expression. The process of
import and use of the bridge remains the same, regardless of whether or not you are
whether you are working with a class or an object.

To use your methods in other modules, import the bridge
using the bare-specifier, i.e., using the package name
followed by the corresponding subpath. As shown below:

<Code>{`import {auth} from 'awesome-api/auth';`}</Code>
