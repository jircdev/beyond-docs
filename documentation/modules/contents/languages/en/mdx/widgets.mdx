<Title>Widgets</Title>

The BeyondJS development architecture in web applications or web projects is designed to work with a <ELink to="https://micro-frontends.org/">Micro frontends</ELink> structure, enabling the integration of different technological stacks in the same project and allowing the developer to have the possibility of evaluate which technology is more convenient for a specific functionality, this is achieved by creating **widgets.**

A **Widget** is a type of <Link to="/docs/bundles">bundle</Link> available in BeyondJS and is implemented through a <ELink to="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Component</ELink> with a <ELink to="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM">shadow DOM</ELink> to encapsulate its content. Being a web component, it can define properties and methods, and it can also be accessed through the JavaScript Web API. Another important advantage of widgets, is that they load dependencies on demand, and only when they are required, optimizing project loading times.

BeyondJS implements widget rendering techniques, this offers the possibility to integrate hybrid renders in a project, you can read more about it in the <Link to="/docs/rendering">rendering chapter..</Link>

BeyondJS provides support for working with frameworks/libraries such as <ELink to="https://reactjs.org/">React</ELink>, <ELink to="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</ELink> and <ELink to="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</ELink> and has the possibility of integrating new libraries or tools available.

<Subtitle>Using React</Subtitle>

React has automatic support motivated by the fact that typescript interprets the tsx code. Therefore, the only thing necessary to be able to use it is to have the dependency installed in npm and define the ts processor in the bundle configuration in the module.json.

React configuration is done through .tsconfig files, each module comes with a file configured by default with compatibility to work with react. you can read more about it in the typescript documentation.

<Subtitle>Using Svelte or Vue</Subtitle>

Cada framework tiene su propio procesador con el nombre de la libreria. Para utilizarlos, solo es necesario incluir el procesador en la configuraci√≥n del bundle.
