<Title>Controller Object</Title>

<Subtitle>Controller definition</Subtitle>

Every widget must expose a defined Controller class. The Controller object is responsible for the declaration and handling of the web component representing the widget. The controller has a structure like the following:

<Code>
{`
import {ReactWidgetController} from '@beyond-js/kernel/react-widget/ts';
import {Page} from './views/page';
export /*bundle*/
class Controller extends ReactWidgetController {
    get Widget() {
        return Page;
    }
}

`}

</Code>

In the code above, the Controller class extends the ReactWidgetController object which is the base controller made available to work with React. BeyondJS has a controller available for the various view frameworks. The objects are:

-   ReactWidgetController and ReactPageWidgetController.
-   SvelteWidgetController and SveltePageWidgetController.
-   VueWidgetController and VuePageWidgetController.

All controllers handle the same interface, but are focused on integrating and working with the view framework used.

**Properties**

-   **Widget** [getter]: Defined as a getter and should return the main view component.
-   **uri** <Link to="/docs/api/uri">[URIObject]</Link> [optional]: Uri object with all the information associated with the current url.

**Methods**

-   **createStore** [function] [optional]: Allows adding logic for handling the widget State, it must return an object with the <Link to="/docs/api/IwidgetStore">IWidgetStore</Link> interface.
-   **initialise** [void] [optional]: Allows you to add logic to be executed before mounting the web component in the HTML DOM.
-   **hide** [void] [optional]: Executed when it has been rendered and it is hidden. This happens when navigating from one URL to another.
-   **show** [void] [optional]: Runs every time the URL is accessed and the page is displayed in the browser.
