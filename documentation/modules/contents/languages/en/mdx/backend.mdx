<Title>Backend-code</Title>

BeyondJS provides a safe and efficient environment for creating backend code, whether you need to work with stand-alone services, task-specific, or looking to implement a client project connected to a backend API.

For BeyondJS purposes, we can classify these code structures into two types:

-   **Backend services**: Node code representing a service running on the backend and can only be used by modules that runs on the backend as well.
-   **Backend APIs**: Allows the connection between the backend-code and the client-code.

<Title>API Server</Title>
<Subtitle>bundle-bridge</Subtitle>

Server APIs in BeyondJS represent functions that execute code on the server and can be consumed from client-code. They handle the logic for connecting to a backend and returning data. It's achieved simply by creating a <Link to="/docs/bundles#bridge">Bundle-bridge</Link>.

To execute backend-code in BeyondJS, is necessary to have the needed distributions configured. If the project is created from the web-backend project type, then is already configured. You can find more information in the <Link to="/docs/distributions">Distributions Chapter.</Link>

<Code>
	{`
    {
        "name": "module-name",
        "bridge": {
            "path": "ts",
            "files": ["*"]
        },
        "platforms": ["*"]
    }
`}

</Code>

Like any module or bundle, it can be managed from the <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link> or manually.

As its name indicates, the bridge-type bundle function as a bridge between client-logic and server-logic. Generally, logic is associated with data management or file management implemented on the server. The bridge enables the implementation and availability of features that are required to be queried from the client and keeps encapsulate on the server those that don’t.

The code for a bundle bridge looks like this:

<Code>
{`
export /*actions*//*bundle*/
class Auth {
    async login(user :string, password: string) {
        if (user !== data.user || password !== data.password) {
            return {status: true, error: "Invalid data" };
        }

        return {status: true, data: {valid: true} }
    }

}

`}

</Code>

An ordinary Javascript object, right?

BeyondJS generates a client object that makes the web-socket connection to the server, executes the code implemented by the developer, and makes the response available in the client code. This enables the developer to abstract from the need to worry about the connection between the client and server layers and allows the code to function as part of the same ecosystem.

Now all you need to do is initialize the server. To do this, it is necessary to create a module with a bundle start that is in charge of starting the <Link to="/docs/bee">BEE.</Link> The code for the bundle start is as follows:

<Code>
    {`
import { listen } from "@beyond-js/backend/listen/ts";
listen();
`}
</Code>

In the <Link to="/tutorial/web">Web Tutorial</Link> available, an implemented bridge allows you to see the operation of the BeyondJS backend APIs in action.

<Title>Magical comments</Title>
<Subtitle>bundle “backend”</Subtitle>

Backend bundles represent JavaScript code executed on the server and used only by modules that also run on the server. In other words, they are like any typical NodeJS service, with the exception that in a development environment are executed through a BEE or BeyondJS process, which increases productivity by enabling it to work with HMR in an automated way and without configuration.
